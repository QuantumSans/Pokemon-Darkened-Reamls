Step into the shadows of the Pokémon world in "Pokémon Darkened Realms," a fan-made game crafted by Sanchit Netke. Set in the familiar yet transformed Kanto region, this game takes you on a journey through a darker, more realistic Pokémon universe where the line between good and evil blurs and the true nature of power is explored.
